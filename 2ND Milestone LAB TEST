Q3 The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer.
    Build a query that returns the person who has spent the most money.

    with fewer!

  LIMIT 1;

    You should only need to use the Customer and Invoice tables.

    Check Your Solution

    Though there are only 24 countries, your query should return 25 rows because
    the United Kingdom has 2 customers that share the maximum."

WITH t1 AS (

  FROM customer c
  JOIN invoice i

  GROUP BY 1,4
  ORDER BY 5 DESC),
t2 AS (
  SELECT country_name, MAX(total_spent) max_spent
  FROM t1
  GROUP BY 1)
  SELECT t1.customer, t1.first_name, t1.last_name, t1.country_name, t1.total_spent
  FROM t1
  JOIN t2
  ON t1.country_name = t2.country_name AND t1.total_spent = t2.max_spent
  ORDER BY 4;
